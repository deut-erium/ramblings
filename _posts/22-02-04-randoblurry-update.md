Perhaps a list of random words is not so fulfilling given it could be just 4 nouns which would be very difficult to put together in a sentence which would end up making no 
sense at all. What I learned from my discussion with Z is that I need a proportionate mix of parts of speech.  
Moreover I can have additional difficulty by using the words in order they were presented!
