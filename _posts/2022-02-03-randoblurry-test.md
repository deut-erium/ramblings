# Trying out the idea of randoblurry

Excited to play the new game I created, I asked a friend of mine if it seems reasonable. Let's call her "Z" and me "D".

Z: This doesn't appear to be much fun.  
D: Try out giving me some 4 random words of your choice.  
Z: Alright.  
Z: Fetish random obligatory meaningless
D: Z's *obligatory* response to trigger word *fetish* of D might seem *meaningless* to some, but to him its his daily source of entertainment.  
Z: Oh it was nice!  
D: I know right!?  
Z: Wait, I'll read your blog again.  
D: Sure, just imagine you will keep on giving 4 random words and I have to connect/extend the story with the context.   
D: I feel the words I am getting by my approach in blog are kinda non-sensical to produce something meaningful.  
Z: Gotcha, here you go with your words.  
Z: derogatory pathway software wall
D: I can feel a *derogatory* wall between us, which is still blocking our *pathway* to communicate in a language of *poetry* called *software*.  
Z: Oooooo.. How about inclusion, rarefraction, supersonic, behavioral 
D: I bet you have a physics book in your hand.  
Z: Yeah felt like studying but now I feel overdosed on caffiene.  
D: Her brain is running at such *supersonic* speeds that I can observe a *rarefraction* of her thoughts, void of *behavorial* *inclusion*  
Z: Nice!. Aggravate punish behold superior.  
D: "*Behold* the *superior* Z!", to *punish* her books, she proclaimed on the last gulp of black coffee, little did she know how it will *agggravate* her perception.   
Z: Damn it!  
D: These are not random enough :P  
Z: Abrogated exhort flagrant cupidity
