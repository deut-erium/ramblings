# Trying out the idea of randoblurry

Excited to play the new game I created, I asked a friend of mine if it seems reasonable. Let's call her "Z" and me "D".  

Z: This doesn't appear to be much fun.  
D: Try out giving me some 4 random words of your choice.  
Z: Alright.  
Z: Fetish random obligatory meaningless  
D: Z's *obligatory* response to trigger word *fetish* of D might seem *meaningless* to some, but to him its his daily source of entertainment.  
Z: Oh it was nice!  
D: I know right!?  
Z: Wait, I'll read your blog again.  
D: Sure, just imagine you will keep on giving 4 random words and I have to connect/extend the story with the context.   
D: I feel the words I am getting by my approach in blog are kinda non-sensical to produce something meaningful.  
Z: Gotcha, here you go with your words.  
Z: derogatory pathway software wall  
D: I can feel a *derogatory* wall between us, which is still blocking our *pathway* to communicate in a language of *poetry* called *software*.  
Z: Oooooo.. How about inclusion, rarefraction, supersonic, behavioral  
D: I bet you have a physics book in your hand.  
Z: Yeah felt like studying but now I feel overdosed on caffiene.  
D: Her brain is running at such *supersonic* speeds that I can observe a *rarefraction* of her thoughts, void of *behavorial* *inclusion*  
Z: Nice!. Aggravate punish behold superior.  
D: "*Behold* the *superior* Z!", to *punish* her books, she proclaimed on the last gulp of black coffee, little did she know how it will *agggravate* her perception.   
Z: Damn it!  
D: These are not random enough :P  
Z: Abrogated exhort flagrant cupidity  
D: She considered her words random enough, only to be *abrogated* by D's linking ability which he uses as a *fragrant* cologne to *exhort* her *cupidity*  
Z: Probity, spurious, wily, fetter  
Z: Oh wait, hey it was flagrant!  
D: Thats how you plant to *fetter* his *wily* responses? Him missing a spelling should no way be considered *spurious* as he can still justify his *probity* by his *flagrant* capability to include words on the fly  
Z: I am a fan already. Go with travesty, vociferous, iconoclast, largess  
D: A *travesty* of Sassy Tharoor, whose vocabulary is actually her *largess*, this *vociferous* lad is a born grammatical *iconoclast*.  
Z: Relegate, beguile, evanescent, maelstorm  
D: Hmmmmm  
D: He *relegates* her hard found words to *beguile* her into producing yet another set of *evanescent* words. Can she in any way stop this furious *maelstorm* growing hungry with each word fed?  
Z: Oh lord you win, enough for today!
