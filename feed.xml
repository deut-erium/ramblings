<p>Imagine yourself a person cut from all the technology and the buzz around it.<br />
Or otherwise suppose yourself to be a human with no memory for abbreviations!</p>

<h2 id="what-can-ai-be">What can AI be?</h2>
<p>I can think of quite a few possibilities</p>
<ul>
  <li>Artificial Intelligence (meh)</li>
  <li>Artificial Insemination (I am really really sorry)</li>
  <li>Alien Invasion</li>
  <li>Aphrodisiac Imagination</li>
  <li>Apocalyptic Incineration</li>
  <li>Aggressive Immigration</li>
  <li>Aperiod Immobilization</li>
</ul>

<p>Did you get an idea already where I am going?</p>

<h2 id="searching-appropriate-articles">Searching appropriate articles</h2>
<p>Let’s search for webpages containing the “AI” but not “artificial intelligence”<br />
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">AI -"artificial intelligence"</code></p>

<p>There are quite some interesting results! let’s hope they dont change :wink:</p>
<h3 id="microsofts-framework-for-building-ai-systems-responsibly"><a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2022/06/21/microsofts-framework-for-building-ai-systems-responsibly/">Microsoft’s framework for building AI systems responsibly</a></h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>Today we are sharing publicly Microsoft’s Responsible AI Standard, a framework to guide how we build AI systems. It is an important step in our journey to develop better, more trustworthy AI. We are releasing our latest Responsible AI Standard to share what we have learned, invite feedback from others, and contribute to the discussion about building better norms and practices around AI.</p>

  <p>Guiding product development towards more responsible outcomes
AI systems are the product of many different decisions made by those who develop and deploy them. From system purpose to how people interact with AI systems, we need to proactively guide these decisions toward more beneficial and equitable outcomes. That means keeping people and their goals at the center of system design decisions and respecting enduring values like fairness, reliability and safety, privacy and security, inclusiveness, transparency, and accountability.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No trace of the term “Artificial Intelligence” in sight. Pure wilderness</p>

<h3 id="teaching-ai-to-perceive-the-world-through-your-eyes"><a href="https://ai.facebook.com/blog/teaching-ai-to-perceive-the-world-through-your-eyes/">Teaching AI to perceive the world through your eyes</a></h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>AI that understands the world from a first-person point of view could unlock a new era of immersive experiences, as devices like augmented reality (AR) glasses and virtual reality (VR) headsets become as useful in everyday life as smartphones. Imagine your AR device displaying exactly how to hold the sticks during a drum lesson, guiding you through a recipe, helping you find your lost keys, or recalling memories as holograms that come to life in front of you.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Okay Artificial Insemination with augmented reality? FB is upto something (evil as usual)</p>

<h3 id="ai-for-good"><a href="https://aiforgood.itu.int/about-ai-for-good/">AI for good</a></h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>The goal of AI for Good is to identify practical applications of AI to advance the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals and scale those solutions for global impact. It’s the leading action-oriented, global &amp; inclusive United Nations platform on AI.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Things do get bizarre out of context, especially all the buzz words around AI.<br />
Please dont find articles on the web for AI. My mind is definitely ruined by this thought<br />

<!--more--></p>

<h1 id="trying-out-the-idea-of-randoblurry">Trying out the idea of randoblurry</h1>

<p>Excited to play the new game I created, I asked a friend of mine if it seems reasonable. Let’s call her “Z” and me “D”.</p>

<p>Z: This doesn’t appear to be much fun.<br />
D: Try out giving me some 4 random words of your choice.<br />
Z: Alright.<br />
Z: Fetish random obligatory meaningless<br />
D: Z’s <em>obligatory</em> response to trigger word <em>fetish</em> of D might seem <em>meaningless</em> to some, but to him its his daily source of entertainment.<br />
Z: Oh it was nice!<br />
D: I know right!?<br />
Z: Wait, I’ll read your blog again.<br />
D: Sure, just imagine you will keep on giving 4 random words and I have to connect/extend the story with the context. <br />
D: I feel the words I am getting by my approach in blog are kinda non-sensical to produce something meaningful.<br />
Z: Gotcha, here you go with your words.<br />
Z: derogatory pathway software wall<br />
D: I can feel a <em>derogatory</em> wall between us, which is still blocking our <em>pathway</em> to communicate in a language of <em>poetry</em> called <em>software</em>.<br />
Z: Oooooo.. How about inclusion, rarefraction, supersonic, behavioral<br />
D: I bet you have a physics book in your hand.<br />
Z: Yeah felt like studying but now I feel overdosed on caffiene.<br />
D: Her brain is running at such <em>supersonic</em> speeds that I can observe a <em>rarefraction</em> of her thoughts, void of <em>behavorial</em> <em>inclusion</em><br />
Z: Nice!. Aggravate punish behold superior.<br />
D: “<em>Behold</em> the <em>superior</em> Z!”, to <em>punish</em> her books, she proclaimed on the last gulp of black coffee, little did she know how it will <em>agggravate</em> her perception. <br />
Z: Damn it!<br />
D: These are not random enough :P<br />
Z: Abrogated exhort flagrant cupidity<br />
D: She considered her words random enough, only to be <em>abrogated</em> by D’s linking ability which he uses as a <em>fragrant</em> cologne to <em>exhort</em> her <em>cupidity</em><br />
Z: Probity, spurious, wily, fetter<br />
Z: Oh wait, hey it was flagrant!<br />
D: Thats how you plant to <em>fetter</em> his <em>wily</em> responses? Him missing a spelling should no way be considered <em>spurious</em> as he can still justify his <em>probity</em> by his <em>flagrant</em> capability to include words on the fly<br />
Z: I am a fan already. Go with travesty, vociferous, iconoclast, largess<br />
D: A <em>travesty</em> of Sassy Tharoor, whose vocabulary is actually her <em>largess</em>, this <em>vociferous</em> lad is a born grammatical <em>iconoclast</em>.<br />
Z: Relegate, beguile, evanescent, maelstorm<br />
D: Hmmmmm<br />
D: He <em>relegates</em> her hard found words to <em>beguile</em> her into producing yet another set of <em>evanescent</em> words. Can she in any way stop this furious <em>maelstorm</em> growing hungry with each word fed?<br />
Z: Oh lord you win, enough for today!</p>]]></content><author><name>deuterium</name><email>farziemailid69@gmail.com</email></author><category term="wordgame" /><category term="randoblurry" /><category term="testing" /><category term="dialogue" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Interaction with a friend about randoblurry]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">New word game - randoblurry</title><link href="https://deut-erium.github.io/ramblings/2022/02/02/randoblurry0001.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="New word game - randoblurry" /><published>2022-02-02T00:00:00+05:30</published><updated>2022-02-02T00:00:00+05:30</updated><id>https://deut-erium.github.io/ramblings/2022/02/02/randoblurry0001</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://deut-erium.github.io/ramblings/2022/02/02/randoblurry0001.html"><![CDATA[<p>How can I come up with something interesting, let alone inspiring, every day without an agenda or motivation?<br />

<h2 id="randoblurry">Randoblurry</h2>
<p>People suck miserably to draw “something” on a blank canvas. Apparently its not the canvas but them :flushed:<br />
Wish I possesed the child like ability to throw my brains away to a canvas without caring about how well it actually looks!<br />
Talking about kids drawing, that reminds me of color books! Which are easier on the brains since it overcomes the hurdle of 
drawing something. Once you have something to work with, you just grate your crayons on it till your stupid little brain is happy.</p>

<p>How about a analogous stupid little template for writing something probably inconsequential but fun?</p>

<ul>
  <li>Using some sort of wordlist to generate new words</li>
  <li>Seeding the random number generator for today’s date (whichever satisfies your format-hunger, just consistent enough to be shared and enjoyed with friends)</li>
  <li>Setting up a style (need to come up with multiple formats later)</li>
  <li>Setting up a difficulty for a style (say generating 4 words at random to write a sentence comprising those words)</li>
  <li>Profit</li>
</ul>

<p>Well who cares if it makes any sense or not, alteast I had fun. Hoping someone else might too!<br />
